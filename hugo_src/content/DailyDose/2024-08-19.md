fo fun
- textual_pygame
	- is this worth making?
	- Write out base class for textual_pygame
	- why?
		- setup textual in a way to make it more convenient to make game
	- what do we have
		- we can draw on a widget surface
		- we can draw
	- How it works
		- We use pygame for their math, surfaces, and other processing.
		- Since we are not running a window instance normally we need to...
			- add key controls
			- add audio
	
	- STRUCTURE
		- I think the structure should somehwhat follow what pygame does so it makes it easier for people to start deving right away
- robblox-ts
	- for fun, going to mess around with this today
	- snippets
	- how it works
		- localserver connects with vscode and roblox studio
			- on updates they rebuild the project file into roblox
		- server vs client
			- server -> everyones instance ie cars, movement, and whatnot
			- client -> player specific, so menu, lighting, door movement
		>LocalScripts only control what the client sees and ServerScripts control what everyone sees. Use RemoteEvents to communicate between the client and the server, but ensure to have sanity checks to exploiters (clients) cannot abuse them!
	
	- Libraries to checkout
		- @rbxts/proton
		- https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rbxts/clack
			- https://github.com/Sleitnick/rbxts-clack

	- goal
		- just take it slow and do a lil bit at a time for fun, it's alot of new tech and will be overwhelming '

more serious
- video-content-pipeline
	- make a better silence detection algo
		- should pick out silence parts with db then merge the points of silence to the close points after we do are processing
		
- video drill - textual app to display video content data.
	- focuses on the silence detection which I need to get better
	- textual app to process video and return the time stamps for editing purposes
		- also output the video into txt file
	- allow for people to add flags to increase the table for data they want.
