MISSION 
Figure what I need to do. Been kind of just loafing around with different projects without a clear line what I want to do.

TODO
textual_pygame
- still not sure if i want to try this... looks hard
- libraries 
	- https://pypi.org/project/textual-plotext/
	- https://github.com/ptmcg/logmerger
video-drill
- I want to learn textual so I'll make an tui that can use my video content pipeline to show data 
	- https://github.com/ptmcg/logmerger
	- for reference something quick and cheap
- lets start off with the layout first
- tmr
	- change the pipeline file to do what we want and make it into a single argument
	- change how the data is formated
	- add different switches and toggles for how the data is sorted in the table

LEARN
- logmerger
	- parser for log files
	- frontend LogMergerApplication(args_ns) (tui)
		- TimestampLinetransformer
		- How does the parsing work?
- textual #textual
	- reactive
		- _descriptor protocol_ -> 
			- auto refreshing 
			- var() from textual.reactive wont causes refreshes
			- built in validates_
			- built in watch_ 
				- check watch01.py for example
	- dev tools
		- super useful
			- allows for double consoles (textual console)
			- from textual import log or TextualHandler with logger()
	- workers
		- `on_worker_state_changed`
		- -- dev shows the lifetime of workers
		- can you decorates for workers as well to auto generate them
	
	- uses id to handle conditions of apps
	
	- widgets
		- mini apps responsible for an area of the screen
		- loading indicator 
			- replaces wigets for a loading icon when generating data
			- (useful for me)
		- base
			- each widget has
			- on_mount
		- Static 
			- Just content with base widget classes
		
	- message_pump.py
		- very important lib cause the entire textual console is just this file. look into!
