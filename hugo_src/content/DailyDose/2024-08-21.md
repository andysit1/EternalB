TODO
- just did research / went into docs
- didn't do much coding
- txt-tui
	- a side quest to make basic projects on the side
	- want to learn how to package a pipx project
	- want to practice input and overall a smaller project might be what we need to build up to video-drill shouldn't take me too long to keep adding content
	[Design Plan]({{< ref "Design Plan" >}}) 


LEARN
- yt : The purest coding style, where bugs are near impossible
	- functional para. -> declarative
	- pretty much it's a type of programming that reduces possible bugs by being modular -> maintainable, function output the same answer each time not dynamic, careful of side effects.
	- closures?
- yt : # Communicating effectively is shockingly uncomplicated
	- know goal -> know you audience (emp.) -> structured -> write it down
	- I got that communicating eff. is a branch of being mindful and knowing your direction you want to take the conversation. Prewrite/think about the path of ideas
