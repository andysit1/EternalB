TODO
- leetcode
	- look into the article
	- start the 75 day of leetcode thingy
- video-drill
	- theme the ui a bit more to make it pretty test in ttui first
	- adopt the ttui structure
	- add specific video features that I want ie 
		- probably set up a structure with events
		- play video
		- push back original video by 5 padding
	- pipeline
		- pad 10 seconds start and end so that we can "regenerate the clip is it's too short"
		- that means that the final txt file we load needs a timestamp value of where the pipeline picked
		- figure a good way to reslice a video
		- after we finish we should pin the videos at the top of a video so we know what is done
- video content pipeline
	- better silencing 
	- better clip selection
	- better logic
- get gift for friend bday 
	- got some cool things for josy, ie ceramics,stamps, and coool gift wrapin
	

Tomorrow

	- add a filter to not generate my notes folder
