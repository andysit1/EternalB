Recently, a big theme in myself is being disapointed in the things that made me mad or upset. There are people dying, family members ill, or not living in a safe envoirnment. Everything I cry about is such dumb reasons. Living in a developed country, no guns to be seen, and a walk away from whatever I want. Here I am, crying about school, work, friends, or whatever next. Such dumb behavior. Be Happy. You won't regret it.

Deep inside I think that this thought is weird. A part of me wants to validate my feelings of feeling being mad over nothing. Isn't our feeling important no matter the size. This is just like how everyone says that you cannot just down play emotions. Honestly, isn't that just being a pussy. Wanting to be validated for what. Truth is that I'm safe, in a happy home, a part of a family with two good parents, and others are dying. Cry about it whomp whomp.
