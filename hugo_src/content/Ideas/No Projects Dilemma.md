Having no project ideas is a problem of lack of ideas/creativity and level of skill.

A few years back I used to have trouble starting probjects. Hard since I never knew what I wanted to learn, often picking projects that focused on technological main stream hype for the sake of resume. Recently, I thought what my issue was and realize why. 

First, when you're new to programming it's hard to start. Every time you look at new syntax, libraries, and just feeling really overwhelmed. Not only does the programming theorical aspect is tough but you need to learn how computers operate depending on the project at hand. It took me awhile to get to this point. Funny to think that it's been over 3 - 5 years since I started coding pretty consistently. Even more funny how little I've improved or how it feels. That's for another time.

Naturally, it's normal to be slow at improving. Getting good is a game of time and jumping from rocks to rocks based on what you learned. Each project acts as a step forwards with new concept, ideas, and proven strategies that 

Creativity is pretty important aswell. In recent times, I grew alot from new hobbies, books, and just overall more content that flows my brain. Reading has been a great help. Since starting it has strengthened my creative powers, thought, and new ideas.
