The Notion of Time is just a pain to my productivity. Have you been in that situation where you need to do work, for me it was homework. For some reason there's a feel of a need to be on the perfect x:00 minute or start intervals. This notion of time and how it equates to certain expectations has plagued my entire life. 

By far one of the most disgusting habits that is deeply ingrained in me, you, and everyone. Perhaps the propagonda for breakfast or the school system embed it's system into me this strict feeling, whatever it is, it's not good.

My goal, is to figure out how to riddify the notion of time. For good. Make actions simiple. wants and needs, do and don't. Just figure out how to stop thinking about time and just do. Life is short and I'm going to die someday. Here I'm worrying about death or the dumb things in life.
