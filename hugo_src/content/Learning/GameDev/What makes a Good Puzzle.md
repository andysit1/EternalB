## My Game

Each room has their own puzzle explaining a mechanic and at the end you are given number cards per stage. At the end you need to traverse the rooms to figure out what you missed to arrange the rooms to escape. 

Misdirection
- Room sequence base on paper layout
- Door lead to missing rooms. 

Eureka Moment in my game is figure out how to traverse the world given Environment.

Space
- Paper Space
	- Paper Space lines do not move
	- Real World Space lines do move
		- You are trying to line up the Paper Space and Real World Space to escape
- Real World Space

Mechanics
- Room Arrangement Mechanic 
- Funny Encounters
	- When player hits x for the first time, queue x  dialogue

- Temperature 
	- Certain home utilities do not start up
	- Question: Where and how do we handle the heating?
		- Should it be based on the day and night time of the world. For example, the paper space is the folded up and there's the sun and moon moving around.
