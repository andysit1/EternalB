# Hi!

I am an 19 year old University Student studying computer science in Canada. Interested in having a place for my notes and being sick of using notepad just for my notes to disappear. Here is my solution! A site where you can find every *messy* thought, things I'm doing on a **daily**, and much more. 

Feel free to read about myself and browse around.

*note*

This website is not a polished source of information. Nothing is edited or checked before upload. It's purely a place for me to share notes and ideas.
