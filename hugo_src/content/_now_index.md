😴Nothing big happened recently. Working on projects that seem interesting and hanging out with friends

📖Been reading [What We Owe the Future](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59802037-what-we-owe-the-future?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=GcMvDTddCv&rank=1) by William MacAskill and [Why We Sleep](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466963-why-we-sleep) by Matthew Walker.

😋Coding my [video content pipeline](https://github.com/andysit1/Video-Content-Pipeline) project. Currently taking a break with other random projects. Mix of Minecraft botting with mineflayer and getting this website up and running asap :)

🏃‍♂Trying to startup YouTube [channel](https://www.youtube.com/@AndyIterations), blogging with [bear](https://andyiterations.bearblog.dev), helping out with open source projects, and pushing my comfort with new hobbies.
