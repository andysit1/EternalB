*about*
Memorable projects base on the time they were created. Some are wrong but it's close enough. Omitted projects that resemble basic tutorials and are finished to a point of content. So many projects in the grave yard that were started or never touched again. Outside of these projects below, I have a lot of folders attempting game engines in c, web dev, flutters apps, and e.t.c. Might post a screenshot :)
## 2024

**Video Content Pipeline** [link](https://github.com/andysit1/Video-Content-Pipeline)  
The goal is to simplify video editing and potentially automate the entire process of clipping large videos on Twitch. Each clip is evaluated and assigned points based on various attributes derived from OpenCV methods. This point system helps weigh clips and can be adjusted in the future according to the specific needs of the video.

**Project-F** [link](https://github.com/andysit1/Project-F)  
Project-F is a top-down Metroidvania action puzzle game about a rain frog. Though the project was not fully completed, it serves as an excellent template for top-down games in Pygame. It includes classes for states, user controls, UI, and other foundational abstractions that most base games would need.

**A Shy Worm - Pixel Game Jam 2024** [link](https://github.com/andysit1/A-Shy-Worm-Pixel-Game-Jam-2024) [itch.io](https://tubbysheep.itch.io/a-shy-worm)  
In "A Shy Worm," you navigate underwater environments filled with various creatures, aiming to avoid contact with other animals. As a shy worm, you are an antisocial entity striving to stay away from others while surviving in a harsh social world. This game was built for the 2024 Pixel Game Jam, with the goal of learning more about boids simulation and enemy AI in Pygame.

## 2023

**Rust Steam Bot** [link](https://github.com/andysit1/RustSteamBot)  
This was a freelance project I worked on over the summer after my first year of university. It’s a coin-flipping service similar to rustypot.com for Rust users. It uses FastAPI to host games and includes an API I built to shuffle IP addresses via a self-made proxy. I learned a lot from this project, particularly about network security, hosting, Docker, and how much I still have to learn about coding.

**LectureSpeeder** [link](https://github.com/andysit1/LectureSpeeder/tree/main)  
A weekend project built to speed up lectures and format them into a PDF. It was really cool at the time since OpenAI tools were becoming popular. Around this time, everyone started making variations of these projects.

## Before 2022
---
Anything on my GitHub from 2022 and earlier consists of projects and scripts from when I first started learning programming. These are more than five years old. I’m keeping them here because it’s nice to see where I started.

**MindPointV2** [link](https://github.com/andysit1/MindPointV2)  
This is a simple mind-mapping tool I made with Raylib to understand how notes and objects work together. By creating this, I learned about design theories, linked lists, and the basics of Makefiles for C++. I remember being stuck for two weeks trying to learn how to compile with C; I didn’t know what Makefiles were at the time.

**Discord-Bot** [link](https://github.com/andysit1/Discord-Bot)  
Originally, I built my first Discord bot in JavaScript, which was a basic ping-pong bot. I found it super exciting, so when I started learning Python, I decided to build a Discord bot in Python using discord.py. I didn’t know about `requirements.txt`, which is pretty funny in hindsight.

**Fast-Notes** [link](https://github.com/andysit1/Fast-Notes)  
A Python web scraper that populates a Tkinter GUI. This was my very first project when learning Python and also my first GitHub project upload. I struggled with the concept of functions and Git when making this.

**Automated-Trashcan** [link](https://github.com/andysit1/automated-trashcan-opener)  
This project marks the beginning of my serious interest in programming. Arduino was the gateway that made me realize I wanted to code more seriously. Before this project, I was just writing random code in Unity, Roblox Lua, and HTML/CSS. This project sparked my coding journey. I’m not sure when I made it, but I think I was around 13 years old.
