 [**Rust Trading Platform**](https://github.com/andysit1/RustSteamBot) **| Freelance Software Developer**                               
* Developed website to use WebSockets through FastAPI to communicate schema models between users and bots, handling functional methods, allowing users to trade skins and items in real time between users  
* Saved **85.71%** by deploying 3 DigitalOcean droplets with containers made with Docker to rotate between addresses, bypassing regional API restrictions instead of buying a custom proxy service  
* Added caching feature to existing open-source botting framework, reducing API call usage of calls to external services, thereby saving **50%** on development costs

 **[Video Content Pipeline](https://github.com/andysit1/Video-Content-Pipeline)** | **Python Developer**                                            
* Developed a pipeline to automate video editing for large video formats such as streams on Twitch and YouTube into a single video, reducing **90%** of the time looking for clips and editing  
* Implemented OpenCV algorithms and manipulated video color format & resolution, thereby increasing processing speed from **2 hours to 30 minutes** with less overall memory usage for a 6-hour stream  
* Visualized data through graphs enabling fast debugging for trends within custom video clip selection algorithms,  and Python-rich logs to facilitate manual timestamp selection

 **[VideoDrill](https://github.com/andysit1/video-drill)** | **Python Developer**                                                           
* Developed VideoDrill, a terminal application to help encode video clips generated by the Video Content Pipeline project perfectly, built to select video clips for school esports streams quickly for  marketing  
* Uses mpv player moded with LUA scripts to help encode the video with more precision with human decisions, achieving a total of **66% of** feature requirements for videodrill and video content pipeline project   
* Packaged with poetry, the application is available on pypi in the early stages, the previous version for .txt file terminal parser is also on pypi called ttui

* Top-down Metroidvania action game collaborated by four developers inspired by Rainworld & Hollow Knight, providing an opportunity to learn to develop software in teams through GitHub  
* Built out multiple systems for the player, dialogue, and game states, and developed **80%** of the codebase as the lead programmer using data structures such as queues, states, and trees.  
* Led team to have good design principles by enforcing a maintained code base through peer code reviews, branching, and established naming conventions for coherent code
