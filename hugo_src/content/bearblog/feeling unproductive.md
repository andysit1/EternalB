I actually don't think I'm being unproductive.

Last night I had a conversation with my dad. I went over my day's normal routine from rock climbing to other important tasks. His response was, "Sounds like your day was packed".

Hearing his words made me question his statement. I did not feel like the day was very productive. Although my tasks were done it was not like I completed significantly large tasks.

Perhaps, it's the amount of fulfillment I mistakenly confused for productivity. Sure a larger task will mostly give me a larger dose of fulfillment but it should not discredit my feelings of being productive. Throughout the day, I completed 5-6 tasks that were of impact for the next week. Yet, it feels like I have no feelings of success.

My current theory is that the potential tasks I could have done are stealing from my joy. In my mind there is always another task to have completed but I did not do it. Studying, going over questions, working on my project, or eating well.

No idea why I feel this way. Likely a question for the soul. If you have a solution email me please.
