blogging feels weird.

I've started blogging recently and I actually have no idea what it is. From my understanding, It's just a place where thoughts are updated regularly by the blogger. Issue is I'm wondering if there's any expectations to the type of content.

I've seen educational, philosophy, rants, and sometimes just plain gibberish. The answer like many is subjective, nothing wrong with any as it's a site to share writing. Just the nature of it feels wrong.

It's like I'm coming to a formal party dressed casual. A giant party where some wear suits while others wear silly furry costumes. Maybe the question isn't what to wear but where I should sit. Does that make sense? Less about fitting in but creating a niche for yourself so you can confidently write knowing it's you, own your voice. 

Welp, I'll keep blogging and thought dumping cause it's fun. Sorry for polluting!

Side note, gibberish is my favorite type of blog. Makes the site much more unserious and welcoming for me. Feels like I can just write with little expectations to be good. "I" used to scare me since in school they teach you to not use that tense but here I don't have to write academically, just write however makes me happy.

Also, there's so many good bloggers that don't appear on the front page. Been reading the [Imperfect Blog](https://imperfect.bearblog.dev/), good reads imo.
