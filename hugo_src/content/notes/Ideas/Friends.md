## Big Deal

Friend's are really a weird subject in my opinions. Everyone makes a big deal about them. Especially parents or people that care about you. 

My friend Willis said something pretty profound, saying your world view is made up of just things you see, thus, makes sense that your friends are a large factor of who you are as they make up a large majority of time spent. At first, I thought this was pretty obvious. Of course, the people that you surround yourself with make up who you are as they are around you.

Specificly, the use of world view in this cause was used really nicely. It makes me think of others aspects of my life that I'm blind sided due to the circumstances. Geological location, cultural, religion, and much more. There are so many different parts of the world that I lack knowledge. How many ideas and thoughts that I have are skewed. Everyday, all the comment sections experience this bias of information. SO hard to make a educated take on anything with this world of dense information.

## Coolness

Was hanging out with Kat and thought that she was very cool. Even had to send her a direct message letting her know what I was thinking. How cool and interesting she was. Got me thinking what is coolness and what do I care about in a person. Kat was a perfect person for me to think about cause she really is that person.

I guess, in my mind it's the harash differeneces of her persoanlities that really shine to me. She comes off as a little grunchy. Outfits that are more on the dark side, her energy low, and posture slutched/loose. Off these attributes it's easy to think she is more negative off the bat. Which is far from truth. Such a pure hearted person. A positive person in disguised.

The idea of these contrasting ideas are so cool to me. Not sure if it's the difference or uniqueness that it creates but I love it. 

Being positive is powerful already but in disguised is too strong. All the benfits without any negatives of being annoying. A perfect combination. By being different/contrasting the positive person troupe it puts our grauds down and then she hits us with the positive energy at full force. 

Ordinary positive people creates a level of skeptism for me to their words of encouragement, but her naw. Too cool. My icon Kat.
