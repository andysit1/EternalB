Having no project ideas is a problem of lack of ideas/creativity and level of skill.

A few years back, I used to have trouble starting projects. It was hard since I never knew what I wanted to learn, often picking projects that focused on mainstream technological hype for the sake of my resume. Recently, I thought about what my issue was and realized why.

First, when you're new to programming, it's hard to start. Every time you look at new syntax, libraries, and just feeling really overwhelmed. Not only is the programming theoretical aspect tough, but you need to learn how computers operate depending on the project at hand. 

Naturally, it's normal to be slow at improving. Getting good is a game of time and jumping from rock to rock based on what you've learned. Each project acts as a step forward with new concepts, ideas, and proven strategies.

Creativity is pretty important as well. In recent times, I've grown a lot from new hobbies, books, and just overall more content that flows through my brain. Reading has been a great help. Since starting, it has strengthened my creative powers, thought processes, and generated new ideas.
