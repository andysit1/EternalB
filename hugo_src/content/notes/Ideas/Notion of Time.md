The Notion of Time is just a pain to my productivity. Have you been in that situation where you need to do work? For me, it was homework. For some reason, there's a feeling of needing to start at the perfect x:00 minute or at specific intervals. This notion of time and how it equates to certain expectations has plagued my entire life.

By far, it's one of the most disgusting habits that is deeply ingrained in me, you, and everyone. Perhaps the propaganda for breakfast or the school system embedded this strict feeling. Whatever it is, it's not good.

My goal is to figure out how to rid myself of the notion of time. For good. Make actions simple. Wants and needs, do and don't. Just figure out how to stop thinking about time and just do. Life is short, and I'm going to die someday. Here I am worrying about death or the dumb things in life.
