Cover: Self Help books are not bad but hard to explain.

Most times self help books usually help with a really specific problem.
Which usually they try to explain by giving context and explain their ideas.
I don't this is a good way of doing it since one of these ideas take so many steps to get to the final destination and everyone has their own way of getting there.
