Sentence Summary: 

I started writing to improve my skills. Posting on bear was just consequence of having random md files on my computer and thought blogging was fun. At the start I was terribly scared to write as my blog [Scaredey Cat](link) mentioned and thought why not just do what I feared most, bad writing. What was the worse could happen and even had a few people reach out which was nice. 

Every post I've posted so far have been a free writing where I did not draft, think hard, or reread to well. At this point, I thought I would get used to writing and not worry to much but it's still lurking in the back. 

It definitely died down but going forward. Not like there would be any reprocassions for posting and writing. No mean comments yet. Some deep parts of me wants to revise.

Let's say I do start drafting and editing my blogs, would that take away from the fun of it? Of course, if I want to get better I need to analyze the work I produce but what if it deters me from continueing. 

New Process

Going forward now I'll continue my free writing but spend maybe a few more days working on the same blog to develop the ideas, sentences, and really give some time to produce better content. Perhaps, it's the feeling of people reading it every so often but I want to make it more enjoyable. Looking back on my old post is funny. It's so not coherent and some letters are capitalized. Things missing and rereading even has me confused to the point of the writing wants to convey. 

Pretty Standard Process.
Free writing -> Draft Ideas -> AI to fix and point out problems -> Do again


How would I Improve the most though?

I need a system to feedback improvement back towards me whenever I write a blog. I need some sort of software or notes to popup to remind me of my lessons and not make the errors once again. Let that brew.
