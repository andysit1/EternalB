Problem

Unsure how to structure opensource projects
Idealistic.

textual-pygame probably needs to based on how textual works and it's structure.
- how does the background layer works
- how does textual-canvas work
- how can we use buttons and stuff with it
- what if people use pygame


We can just follow an opensource repo.
