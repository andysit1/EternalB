## Features
- check encoder to see if viable to process
- can we process each clip to lower the volume slightly at the start and end of each clips to make it nicer?
- Add some slight editing to the start of the video?

# Video Download 
- Problems with downloading through twitch downloader. Not sure how it's working and why it's not downloading.

# Clipping Issues
- We can chunk the videos into 30 mins then we can just do the same silence pipeline commands. Inorder to get better volume detect. Will it take longer? might.


# clip mode vs video creation mode


## BUGS
- The cuts are not clean
  - It keeps cutting/reiterating the cuts again
  might be good idea to increase the merge seconds
  
- input videos are causing a problem too
  - not sure why

- Unfinished clips base on the sentence speech, really annoying

- Yvonie clip is not working well
