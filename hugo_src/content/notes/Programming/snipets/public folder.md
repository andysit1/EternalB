Interesting how public folders work.

Context: I just set up my first workflow to the github pages. Since, I was using hugo a static website generator, it generated the links base on the public folder location.

In this case, you can specific the baseURL="yourdomain.com" to set the relative pathing. I assuming that the public folder just is swapped out with the baseURL. Thus, all links that worked in the baseURL in development works the same in production. Really interesting how that works. Just something I wanted to remember.
